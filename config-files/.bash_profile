  # Library Paths
  # These variables tell your shell where they can find certain
  # required libraries so other programs can reliably call the variable name
  # instead of a hardcoded path.

#     # Node Path from Homebrew I believe
#     export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"

#     # then you don't have to update your bash_profile
#   # Configurations
#     # GIT_MERGE_AUTO_EDIT
#     # This variable configures git to not require a message when you merge.
#     export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT='no'
#     # Editors
#     # Tells your shell that when a program requires various editors, use sublime.
#     # The -w flag tells your shell to wait until sublime exits
#     # export VISUAL="atom"

#   # Paths
#     # The USR_PATHS variable will just store all relevant /usr paths for easier usage
#     # Each path is seperate via a : and we always use absolute paths.
#     # A bit about the /usr directory
#     # The /usr directory is a convention from linux that creates a common place to put
#     # files and executables that the entire system needs access too. It tries to be user
#     # independent, so whichever user is logged in should have permissions to the /usr directory.
#     # We call that /usr/local. Within /usr/local, there is a bin directory for actually
#     # storing the binaries (programs) that our system would want.
#     # Also, Homebrew adopts this convetion so things installed via Homebrew
#     # get symlinked into /usr/local
#     export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin"
#     # Hint: You can interpolate a variable into a string by using the $VARIABLE notation as below.
#     # We build our final PATH by combining the variables defined above
#     # along with any previous values in the PATH variable.
#     # Our PATH variable is special and very important. Whenever we type a command into our shell,
#     # it will try to find that command within a directory that is defined in our PATH.
#     # Read http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/ for more on that.
#     export PATH="$USR_PATHS:$PATH"
#     # If you go into your shell and type: echo $PATH you will see the output of your current path.
#     # For example, mine is:
#     # /Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392@global/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/bin:/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/share/python:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:
